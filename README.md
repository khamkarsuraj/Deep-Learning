Q3-Task3-Subtask2- souce code for Part3.3.2 Flatness VS. Generalization\
HW1_Report.pdf - Assignment report with analysis of code and results\

To run these files, the following libraries are required:\
python 3.8\
Pytorch 1.7\
Tensorflow 2.4\
Matplotlib 3.2.2\
Numpy 1.19\

The dataset required to run the source code is the MNIST dataset from the torchvision datasets library in pytorch. Once the dataset is downloaded to this pathfile, it can be used by every other file and is the only file you will need to download. In every file that requires the MNIST dataset, there is a line of code that grabs the dataset.
It is provided below:
trainingSet = datasets.MNIST('', train=True, download=False, ...)
To download the dataset, change the download option to True. This is done for you in the first source code file (Part1_TrainOnActualTask.ipynb). You will need internet connect to download the dataset.
